# etch-a-sketch
My take on the desktop 'etch-a-sketch' project idea from The Odin Project.
It's the first public version - there might be some changes in the future.


## Options:
1. Switch between normal and rainbow pen options.
2. Pick color: Choose custom pen color.
3. Eraser: the same mechanism as drawing pen, but it "draws" with current background color.
4. Grid: Switch the grid look on/off. 
5. Background: Choose custom background color.
______________________________
6. Clear: Sets the whole board back to current background color.

## Slider: 
Pick the grid size. Smallest option is 8x8 and it goes up to 96x96. Steps are a multiple of 8.

## Tech:
HTML, SCSS and JavaScript


I got some tips from Kevin Powell's ["Getting started with Sass"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMYRhK9vRPatSlb-9r0aKgh) YT series that helped immensely.
